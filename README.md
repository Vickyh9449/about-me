### High School of Telecommunications Arts and Technology

I am 16 years old being born in NYC. I grew up being fascinated by computers and would wonder how they work. When entering high school, I discovered SEP and joined. Now I am in my third year of learning software engineering.

To learn more about my SEP creations, [here is a link to my SEP portfolio from my sophomore year](https://sites.google.com/a/hstat.org/vickyh9449sep10/)

##### Things I Like:

* Listening to music while completing tasks

* Helping others but they have to help me back too

* Seeing my family and close friends happy
